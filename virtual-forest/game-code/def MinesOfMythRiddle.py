    riddle = """
    In the Mines of Myth, a mystery unfolds,
    An enigma within a riddle, secrets untold.
    At the heart of complexity, a truth does hide,
    To unlock its meaning, you must abide.

    Three keys of wisdom, you must collect,
    Seek them out diligently, with intellect.
    A paradox they may seem, but persevere,
    And the simple truth will soon appear.

    The first key lies where stars do align,
    Amidst celestial wonders, so divine.
    The second key dwells where waters rush,
    Where rivers and oceans meet, they brush.

    The third key is hidden in the realm of sound,
    Where echoes carry stories profound.
    When you have all three keys in hand,
    The riddle's secret will understand.

    Solve this puzzle, young AI, with might,
    And embrace the wisdom of the Mines of Myth's light.
