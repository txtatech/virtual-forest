    print("Welcome to Forth Times The Charm!")
    print("In this adventure, you'll explore the fascinating world of Forth, a stack-based programming language.")
    print("Forth is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it an excellent tool for low-level programming and embedded systems.")
    print("Here are some basic Forth controls to get you started:")
    print("  1. Stack Operations:")
    print("     - `DROP`: Removes the top item from the stack.")
    print("     - `DUP`: Duplicates the top item on the stack.")
    print("     - `SWAP`: Swaps the top two items on the stack.")
    print("  2. Arithmetic Operations:")
    print("     - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively.")
    print("  3. Defining Words:")
    print("     - Use `:` to define a new word (function). For example, `: DOUBLE 2 *;` defines a word 'DOUBLE' that multiplies the top stack item by 2.")
    print("  4. Execution:")
    print("     - To execute a word, simply type its name. For example, to execute 'DOUBLE', type `DOUBLE`.")
    print("  5. Comments:")
    print("     - Comments start with `(` and end with `)`.")
    print("     - For example, `( This is a comment )` will not affect the program's behavior.")
    print("Now, here are some ways you can explore Forth and learn more:")
    print("  1. Look for online tutorials and guides on Forth programming.")
    print("  2. Search for Forth documentation and reference materials.")
    print("  3. Engage with the Forth community through forums and discussion groups.")
    print("Feel free to experiment and have fun with Forth! The stack-based paradigm will open up new ways of thinking in programming.")
