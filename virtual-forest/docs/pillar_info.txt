Pillar is a standalone Python program that creates and accesses Python scripts dynamically.

It's not recommended to use such a mechanism in a larger script, especially when you're trying to create or edit Python code on the fly.

This can lead to security risks and potential errors, as dynamically generating code can be unpredictable and potentially unsafe.

However, if you still wish to use this, you can do so by importing the `pillar` function in your main script and then calling it when needed.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Save the provided script as `pillar.py` in the same directory as your main script.

2. In your main script, import the `pillar` function:

```python
from pillar import pillar
```

3. Call the `pillar` function in your main script:

```python
pillar()
```

Here's a detailed explanation of what the script does:

1. **Introduction:** The program starts by printing a welcome message to the user.

2. **User Interaction Loop:** The program then enters an infinite loop, where it repeatedly asks the user what action they want to perform: creating a new Python function, accessing an existing one, or exiting the program.

3. **Creating a Python Function:**
   - If the user chooses to create a function, the program asks the user to provide a name and content for the function.
   - The program generates a unique, random string that acts as a "trigger" for the function. This isn't used anywhere in the given code, so its purpose is unclear.
   - The program creates a new Python script with the user-provided function name and content. The new script is saved in the same directory as `pillar.py`.

4. **Accessing an Existing Python Function:**
   - If the user chooses to access a function, the program asks for the name of the function.
   - The program attempts to open and read the corresponding Python script file. If the file exists, the program displays its contents. If the file does not exist, the program informs the user.

5. **Exiting the Program:**
   - If the user chooses to exit, the program prints a goodbye message and breaks the loop, effectively ending the program.

Please note that this script doesn't actually execute the Python functions it creates or accesses. It merely writes Python code to a file or reads Python code from a file. To execute the functions, you'd need to import the generated Python files in your code, which could pose a security risk if the content of the function isn't controlled or validated properly.
